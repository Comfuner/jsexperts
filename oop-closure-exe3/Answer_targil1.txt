The answer is:

A1,A2,A3 will all show an alert of "4" which is the last iterated value of i, 
the addEventListeners will be invoked in a later time so the value that they will alert will be the last iteration, which ia i = 4.

B1,B2,B3 will accordingly to i will produce an alert of "1","2","3" this is because of the use of a module pattern
where in every iteration of i the value i is passed into the inner closure return function, and waits for the listener invocation.
